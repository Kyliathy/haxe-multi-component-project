# Haxe Multi Component Project

Hello and welcome, Haxe pilgrim.

This repository is a (slowly) evolving living example of how to use various tech stacks with Haxe.

It has been built starting from Gama11's excellent repository for reproducing Haxe compiler issues, which I also warmly recommend as it supports more targets. 

https://github.com/Gama11/HaxeRepro

While this repository currently only supports the JavaScript target, it provides an example for a complete workflow for developing both Client and Server applications using Haxe.

The main strength of this workflow is its Live Reload capabilities, which have been contributed to by https://github.com/lbergman of Hacksaw Studios.

Now please go in `/HaxeRepro` and read the readme.md there :).
