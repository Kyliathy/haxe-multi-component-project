# Haxe Multi Component Project

A project that demonstrates the Haxe tech stack using VS Code and multiple targets &amp; components.

# JavaScript Client Application

- Load `HaxeRepro` in VS Code.
- Down in the `Status Bar`, next to `Haxe`, you will see `Neko` as `Current Configuration`. Click there and change it to `JavaScript`.
- Launch a debug session by choosing to run `JavaScript (Client)` (the other JavaScript target will compile for Node JS).

# Current issues

- Despite Lib1 and Lib2 being specified in `build.hxml`, cannot compile `Human.hx`.
- No navigation available among the files of the project.
