# Haxe Multi Component Project

A project that demonstrates multiple Tech Stacks using Haxe and VS Code. The project is focused on showing how multiple libraries can be used.

# JavaScript Client Application

- Load `HaxeRepro` in VS Code.
- Down in the `Status Bar`, next to `Haxe`, you will see `Neko` as `Current Configuration`. Click there and change it to `build.hxml`.
- You can launch a debug session in two ways:
  - Launch `start.bat` in `HaxeRepro`. This will launch the project in **Live Reload Mode**.
  - Launch a debug session by choosing to run `JavaScript (Client)` (the other JavaScript target will compile for Node JS).
